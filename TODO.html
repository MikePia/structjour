    <h1>TODO</h1>
    <h3>Version 0.93-Alpha.001</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3> A forming plan </h3>
        sqlalchemy implementation is disruptive but I plan to complete it. I plan to benefit from multiple db options,
        but its not a free benefit.
        The sqlite Numeric columns can be problems. In trade_sum, plan to remove columns that are the results of other
        columns. But wait till all
        the tables are sqlalchemy declarative models. That should include rr, realrr, sldiff, targdiff, mktval, maxloss.
    </div>
    <div>
        Among the benefits will be a more modular approach to statements enabling a sane and maintainable approach to
        including broker statements.
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Consider these-- functionality from various commercial apps </h4>
        Prelim is to keep focus on how structjour is unique and to stick to its vision of an application to help
        day-traders review trading strategy. Its the 'now' focus that is the central focus and strength. Also structjour
        will
        remain an open source desktop application for a specific audience, which will increase when the focus turns to
        supporting
        broker statements. (Not ready to begin that work. Need a kind of framework for including statements. This will
        begin after the
        sqlalchemy models are implemented and used in everything)
    </div>

    <div>A monthly review mechanism. Don't know how this looks yet.</div>
    <div>A list of all trades limited by dates -- basically all the information currently exported to the front page of
        disciplined trader displayed as a table. Add to that, green and red visuals, a column of green and red bars,
        size = pnl. Think about how to include
        r data.
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>The long planned statistics and long term view-- </h3>
        <div>Planning this has been a road block for me as I don't have a clear vision on it. But my murky vision of it
            includes many types of charts with
            controls to vary the time frame and to filter based on strategy, tags, time of day, day of week. Also equity
            over days, months and years needs
            to be visually presented. This leaves a mind-boggling number of possible interface approaches.
        </div>
        <div>
            The progress could gain momentum if there were a prior interface and visual plan to roughly follow that
            includes the types of charts and
            the nature of the controls and filters. Like the development of OpenOffice as based on Word and all. This
            would give the statistics project some
            needed momentum.
        </div>

        <div>Statistics on numbers, wins, losses, total pnl based on strategy. Include pie chart showing number of used
            strategies and their win ratio/average amount</div>
        <div>Some multi-day view of trade notes and daily notes
        </div>
        <div>Profit calendar is a calendar and navigation tool in which green days are green. Clicking on a day opens
            the day
            on the front page
        </div>

            inconsistent. Some of them are excel formulas and some are numbers. They should all be numbers or empty.
            Excel formulas should only exist up to the point they are used. The most recent date is march 3, 2019 so it
            probably does not affect any PyPi distributions, but it should auto correct as statments are saved. ... And
            it does already but... I think it lost explain and notes.
            <code>

    <ol>
        <li> <span class="green">Add backup</span>-restore-initialize utility.</li>
        <li> <span class="green">Chart date widget bug. </span>In ChartMage, the widgets are attempting to upgrade but its in a non-gui thread. Move it out to chartMagic1, 2, and 3.</li>
        <li> <span class="green">API Chooser </span>should choose a working api. When AV trade failed rules, it did not pick up the next choice. (Can't get it to fail)</li>
        <li><span class="green">Create a setting </span>for each api with a datetime value to indicate quota has been reached until a given time. Note that for av, just implement the 5 per minute throttle as you really have to work at it to reach 500 with the throttle. They don't consistently reset the 1 minute time limit. Try 2 minutes. The api will roll on to the next one and this whould minimize the interference. Implement for av, bc, fh and wtd </li>
        <li><span class="green">Add rules to the </span>api chooser to check for quota</li>
        <li><span class="green">Put the apiChooser </span>call in a while loop dependent on apiList having a value. Created a method in APIChooser to do it.</li>

        <li> <span class="green">Add real RR</span> that figures the actual Reward/StopLoss. Some problems. It involves updating the database, and the layout form. The necessary changes have tentacles throughout the app.</li>
        <li> <span class="green">Prelim. Create DB Migration procedure </span> The db update should occur before running the program. Will place updates in migrations folder with numbered files. New files for more updates will increment the number and have a descriptive name as to the module where the db table creation is. The updates need to be tied to app version numbers. That also needs to be implemented. For such a small change, this has many steps and they affect future development. It will be minimally django like in preparation for the app to be much more django like. Start thinking about how to move all db stuff into django model classes. Finally with all the changes made in the past week, there are bound to be issues. So I should start a fork in order to keep bug fixes current on the pre migrations code.</li>
